 MVC Website
===========

[This is a website](http://roomatematcher.com/) I built using an MVC framework I also created.  I built it from the ground up.  The only thing I didn't build was obviously the ADODB library used to transfer data about blog posts, categories, and users from the database.  The database used was MySQL (PHP MyAdmin).  Administrative capabilities are incorporated so admins can delete posts, comments, categories, as well as registered users.

APIs Used:
- USA Today 
- The Onion 
- CDYNE Weather service (returning the weather based off of a search using your zip code)
